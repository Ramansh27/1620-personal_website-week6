    <h1>A little about me</h1>
    <p1>
        I am former Graduate from the <strong>Chemical and Environmental Technology 
        as well as Project Management from BCIT.</strong> My <strong>primary</strong> 
        driving factors towards opting for this program are: 
        <ul>
            <li>rapidly developing nature, </li>
            <li>the fast-paced environment, and</li>
            <li>to evolve myself and my knowledge base with ongoing technologies</li>
        </ul>
        I was born in <em>New Delhi, India</em> and moved to Canada a little over 9 
        years ago. <em>Currently,</em> I work as a <strong>Security and Safety Consultant 
        for BC Hydro Corporate Security</strong> and would like to use this program 
        as a supplementary resource to work towards a career in Cybersecurity.
        This semester, I'm enrolled in:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/acit1620/">ACIT 1420 - Fundamental Web Technologies</a></li>
            <li>ACIT 1515 - Scripting for IT</li>
            <li>ACIT 1630 - Dabase Systems</li>
        </ul>
